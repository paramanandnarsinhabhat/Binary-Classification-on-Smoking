# Binary Prediction of Smoker Status using Bio-Signals

This repository contains the code for a machine learning project that predicts an individual's smoking status based on various health indicators and bio-signals.

## Project Structure

The project is organized into several directories, each with its specific purpose:

- `data_exploration`: This directory contains scripts used for the initial exploration of the data.
- `data_modelling`: This directory contains scripts related to the modeling aspects of the project, including model selection and evaluation.
- `data_training`: This directory contains scripts used for training the machine learning models.
- `Utilities`: This directory contains common utility functions that are shared across the project.

Each directory contains a Python script or scripts that contribute to that part of the project pipeline.

## Files

- `data_exploration/exploration.py`: Script for exploring the dataset, visualizing distributions of features, and initial data analysis.
- `data_modelling/modeling.py`: Script for building and evaluating the prediction model.
- `data_training/model_training.py`: Script for training the model with the training dataset.
- `Utilities/common_utilities.py`: Shared utility functions used across the project for tasks like data splitting, scaling, and more.

## Usage

To run the project scripts, navigate to the appropriate directory and execute the Python script. For example, to train the model, you would do the following:


## Dependencies

This project requires the following Python libraries:

- pandas
- scikit-learn
- numpy

Ensure you have these installed in your Python environment before running the scripts.
